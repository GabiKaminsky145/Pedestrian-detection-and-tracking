Usage - The program file is called "annotation.py". Please provide the video path as an argument.

Given a video that includes pedestrians, one person is marked on a frame using a bounding
rectangle. Then, the program extracts feature points and locates the same pedestrian on following
frames. The program corrects the location and size of the boundog box on any frame.
Whenever the detected pedestrian leaves the frame, the program detects anew pedestrian to follow.


Steps:
1. Detect a pedestrian in the first frame - using hog detector
2. Extract feature points (read corners) - using ShiTomasi corner detection
3. Compare the previous and current frames, and adjust the bounding box according to the points' locations


Notes:
1. It is possible to adjust the feature_params for the ShiTomasi corner detection, it can improve the quality of the pedestrian tracking, depending on the video.

2. A sample video is included to test the program.

3. There is another folder called "tracker" that contains another code file that does not extract feature points but rather uses TrackerCSRT to track the pedestrian, and also a two sample videos.
 We've decided to include it as well as the results seem slightly better. It's called "tracker.py" . You are welcome to examine it for reference.
* In this vesrion a name of a video as an argument is required
** code steps are described as comments on top of the file "tracker.py"
